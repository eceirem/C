## Introduction

This repository serves as a comprehensive resource for learning and practicing C programming. It includes various topics covered in my university and additional materials for self-study.

## algorithms

The (algorithms/) directory contains implementations of various algorithms covered in class, such as sorting and searching algorithms. Each algorithm is implemented in a separate file with detailed comments.

## dietel_and_c_exercises
1)Arrays
In the (dietel_and_c_exercises/array_exercises/) directory includes examples and exercises related to array manipulation, including multi-dimensional arrays and common operations like insertion, deletion, and traversal. 
Additionally, it includes implementations methods for accessing elements via indices, and operations like merging two arrays.

2)Dietel's Book
In the (dietel_and_c_exercises/deitel/) directory, you will find solutions to the end-of-chapter exercises from the "C: How to Program" book by Deitel. 
Each solution is organized by chapter and includes both the problem statement and the solution code.

3) Professor's Assignments and Personal Studies
In the (dietel_and_c_exercises/basic_exercises/) directory, contains the assignments given by my professor throughout the course. Each assignment includes the problem description, requirements, and my solution.
Also i have included additional topics and programs that I have studied independently. This includes advanced topics, projects, and experimental code.

## Conclusion

Each folder corresponds to a specific topic or set of materials. Feel free to clone the code to review or develop further.

Thank you for exploring the repository!
