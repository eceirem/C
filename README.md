## Introduction
This repository serves as a comprehensive resource for learning and practicing C programming. It includes various topics covered in my university and additional materials for self-study.

## algorithms
The (algorithms/) directory contains implementations of various algorithms covered in class, such as sorting and searching algorithms. Each algorithm is implemented in a separate file with detailed comments.

## c_files
The (c_files/) directory contains introductory-level file operations in C programming. For more advanced examples, you can explore the (labs/) directory where more complex exercises and solutions are located.

## dietel_and_c_exercises

1) Arrays

In the (dietel_and_c_exercises/array_exercises/) directory includes examples and exercises related to array manipulation, including multi-dimensional arrays and common operations like insertion, deletion, and traversal. 
Additionally, it includes implementations methods for accessing elements via indices, and operations like merging two arrays.

2) Dietel's Book

In the (dietel_and_c_exercises/deitel/) directory, you will find solutions to the end-of-chapter exercises from the "C: How to Program" book by Deitel. 
Each solution is organized by chapter and includes both the problem statement and the solution code.

3) Professor's Assignments and Personal Studies

In the (dietel_and_c_exercises/basic_exercises/) directory, contains the assignments given by my professor throughout the course. Each assignment includes the problem description, requirements, and my solution.
Also i have included additional topics and programs that I have studied independently. This includes advanced topics, projects, and experimental code.


## labs
The (labs/) directory contains lab exercises that I completed during my course in 2023, along with solutions I developed for lower grades in 2024. Additionally, I have created Turkish-language tutorial videos explaining these lab solutions and subject topics.

## Conclusion

Each folder corresponds to a specific topic or set of materials. Feel free to clone the code to review or develop further.

Thank you for exploring the repository!
